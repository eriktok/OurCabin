# OurCabin - React Native App

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- React Native development environment set up
- iOS: Xcode and CocoaPods
- Android: Android Studio and Android SDK

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-private-repo-url>
   cd OurCabin
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual configuration values
   ```

4. **iOS Setup (if targeting iOS)**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   bundle install
   bundle exec pod install
   cd ..
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

## 🏗️ Development

### Running the App

#### Android
```bash
npm run android
# or
yarn android
```

#### iOS
```bash
npm run ios
# or
yarn ios
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Linting
npm run lint

# Testing
npm test
```

```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files or sensitive configuration
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
- API keys and secrets should be managed through environment variables
- Review `.gitignore` to ensure sensitive files are excluded

## 🚀 Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
